# Configuration

![ross shush](images/ross_shushing.jpg)

Keep it to a minimum


---

## black


```
# pyproject.toml

[tool.black]
line-length = 120
```

---

## isort

```
# pyproject.toml

[tool.isort]
profile = "black"
line_length = 120
skip_gitignore = true
```

---

## flynt

Nothing to see here üëÄ ...

## bandit

```
# .bandit

[bandit]
targets: src,tests
skips: B101
```

- [B101 - assert used](https://bandit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/plugins/index.html#complete-test-plugin-listing)

Note:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è  Don't confuse the "ini" file **AND/OR** the "yaml" config file. ‚ö†Ô∏è
- assert is removed with compiling to optimized byte code.
- Bandit likes to complain about random, use the secrets module instead if you can or silent individual lines with `# nosec: B311`

## flake8/flake8-docstrings

```
# .flake8

[flake8]
max_line_length = 120
ignore = W503,D1
docstring-convention = google
```

- W503: Line break occurred before a binary operator
- D1: [Missing docstring](http://www.pydocstyle.org/en/stable/error_codes.html)

Note:
I don't care about missing docstrings as I try to keep them to a minimum. Instead I prefer to rely on explicit variable and function names, as well as type hints.

Note:
Notice that everything is setup as "local" because I keep track of the packages (black, flake8, etc.) in my dev-requirements.in.
